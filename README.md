## Browser Requirements

JupyterLite requires one of the following modern web browsers:

- Firefox 90+
- Chromium 89+

Use the normal window, i.e. `New Window` not a `New Private Window` or other anonymous window (known performance issues e.g. https://github.com/jupyterlite/jupyterlite/issues/679).

## Jupyter Requirements

%matplotlib inline needed to display matplotlib graphs in the jupyter notebooks.

## Keyboard Shortcuts for working in a Jupyter Notebook
* Use shift+enter to run code cells
* Use tab for auto-completion options
* Try shift+tab whilst writing a function to bring up it's documentation (may or may not work in Deepnote)
